* As a visitor I want to be able to see a single photo in a bigger scale. 
* As a buyer I want to be able to see price for every photo and a total for my purchases at 
any time so I can menage the amount I spent.
* As a user I want to be able to register so that I have my own account and can track my 
activities in the website.

* As a user I want to be able to read about the author/photographer so that I can understand his 
motivation and inspiration.

* As an Owner I want to be able to edit an item so that I can change description or price of a photo.

### Design 

* Color Scheme 
   * The main navigation menu have dark (black-blue) background and white color text. 
   * The pages content have reverce color scheme using white backgrounds and black text. White is 
   also one of the best choices when showing photos so all other colors can pop out.  

* Typography 
   * The fonts used in the project are Kaushan Script for headers and titles, and Kavivanar for 
   other text content. Sans Serif is used as the fallback font in case the font isn't being imported 
   into the site correctly.
