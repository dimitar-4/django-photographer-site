* Color Scheme 
   * The main navigation menu have dark (black-blue) background and white color text. 
   * The pages content have reverce color scheme using white backgrounds and black text. White is 
   also one of the best choices when showing photos so all other colors can pop out.  

* Typography 
   * The fonts used in the project are Kaushan Script for headers and titles, and Kavivanar for 
   other text content. Sans Serif is used as the fallback font in case the font isn't being imported
