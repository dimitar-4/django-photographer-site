### Design 

* Color Scheme 
   * The navigation menu, buttons, text and some cards backgrounds use the Bootstrap's class "dark" (black-blue color). 
   * White backrounds are used throughout the project. It's basic choice when showing photos so that all other colors can pop out.
   * Bootstrap's class "light" and color #fafafa (in css files) are used for text color on dark backgrounds.    

* Typography 
   * Font Kaushan Script is used for headerstitles throughout the project. 
   * Font Kavivanar is used for the remaining text content in the project. 
   * Sans Serif is used as the fallback font in case the other fonts arn't being imported into the site correctly.
